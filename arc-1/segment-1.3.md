  - The party investigated Daisy's bedchambers and found some hidden sketches of the half orc, along with the initials DL + ER doodled all over.
  - It looks like Daisy packed a bag before she left, so the party got a list of the missing jewelry, clothing, and other affects.
- Decided it would be a good idea to go to Clicker's Curios in Driftwood to ask Clicker the Fence to keep an eye out for the missing items.
- The party also thought it would be a good idea to make posters out of the sketches of Emmet Rockhead at Bloodpen Printing to help find the half-orc more quickly.

### 21st of Highsun, 765 (cont.)

- The party tried to convince Daisy Larkspur (Marigold)'s parents, Atlan and Nolwyn Larkspur to give them 5000 gp to pay a wizard to scry on Daisy. Atlan didn't want to hand over 5000 gp to a middle-man, and instead decided to contact KBTM Intercity Cooperative to scry on Daisy.

### 22nd of Highsun, 756 (cont.)

- After investigating the Ironclad Fountain crime scene, Seplo and Dottie went to the Yellowbell Constabulary to cast _Speak with Dead_ on the first unidentified victim.
- The victim's mind was shattered, and she kept repeating an odd version of an elven nursery rhyme in between answers. The party learned her name was Clara Birdthistle, a wood elf who lived in a flophouse in Softbark. She was new the city before her death and she had no close friends.
- Seplo and Dottie suspect the butcher may be some sort of clockmaker or someone skilled with machinery.
- The pair also noticed a connection between the deaths of the elves and the party's shared dream while under the influence of the Iriswood Tea.
- While mulling over this connection, a commotion at the constabulary alerted Dottie and Seplo to the discovery of the Butcher's black cab, abandoned outside Crabgrass Park.
- After rushing to the scene, Dottie went over to the carriage and after looking over the carriage tried the door, triggering a fiery explosion, killing two horses and a couple constables.
- Out of the wreckage crawled six mechanical spiders, each the size of a large dog.
